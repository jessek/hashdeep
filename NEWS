Version 1.11 - 31 Mar 2006
         - Added piecewise mode -p
	 - Added support for using md5deep output while file sizes (-z mode) in
	   matching mode.
	 - Added flush to output after newline generation in helpers.c 
	 - Fixed SHA-1 to work on 64-bit platforms (changed unsigned long to uin32_t)
	 - For good measure, eliminated a few other unsigned long references
	   throughout the source code
         - Added -W to the compiler flags to catch lots of other little bugs,
	   many little fixes. Mostly eliminating comparisons between signed and
	   unsigned. Some warnings, especially "unused paramter" are ok.

Version 1.10 - 2 Feb 2006
         - Fixed Tiger hashes being displayed in big endian instead of little endian
	     Thanks to Peter Chuenkov (aka ODB) for finding this bug
	 - Fixed cosmetic bug in usage message

Version 1.9.3 - 5 Jan 2006
         - Added Cygwin as a supported platform
	 - Fixed expert mode to remove a number of logical errors
	   that prevented the program from correctly identifying which 
	   files should be hashed. Symbolic links, in particular, were not 
	   being chosen or excluded correctly.
	 - Added quiet mode, -q, filename is omitted from the output.
	 - Added Makefile directive macg5 to compile OS X G5 specific code
	 - Fixed comparisons between signed and unsigned variables in helpers.c
	    and dig.c

Version 1.9.2 - 14 Nov 2005
         - Fixed Makefile to include compiler optimizations for hashing algorithms

Version 1.9.1 - 8 Nov 2005
         - Fixed bug when processing symlinks to directories introduced in
	   version 1.9 by accidently removing known good code. Oops.

Version 1.9 - 7 Nov 2005
         - Changed the existing return values and added ones for the matching modes 
	   to indicate if any of the input files did not match a known hash and 
	   if any hashes were unused. See "RETURN VALUES" section of the manpage.
- Added -n mode to display which files from the list of known hashes did
    not match any of the input files. 
- Fixed dig.c code to correctly handle links to Solaris doors.
- Fixed cosmetic bug that caused the leading slash to be omitted from the
    output under 'which matching file', or -w mode.
- Changed text displayed in matching modes for standard input. Now displays
    just "stdin" in matching mode
- Fixed bug in files.c:valid_hash that caused crash by casting
    character value into a signed integer. 
- Fixed bug in BSD hash file importing that caused crash when processing a 
    line with two parenthesis but was shorter than a valid hash. 
- Fixed cosmetic bug in hash.c:update_display to prevent the first time 
    estimate to be wildly off if it takes more than one second to read
    the first megabyte of each input file.
- Simplified hash.c by removing match_name from hash_info structure
- Minor changes to Makefile defines


Version 1.8 - 8 Aug 2005

- Added Tiger algorithm to make tigerdeep.
- Added -k mode to insert asterisks before filename, like md5sum -b
- Fixed a bug that prevented the first BSD style hash from being 
    loaded during any of the matching modes.
- Continued to simplify the Makefile. To wit:
   - Changed checks for __WIN32 to _WIN32, which is defined by the compiler.
     Removed -D__WIN32 from the Makefile.
   - Greatly reduced the number of instructions for cross compiling
   - Simplified rules for building all applications


Version 1.7 - 23 May 2005

- Added support to use BSD style hashes in matching modes
- Fixed support for Hashkeeper files that have directory information.
    Matt Kucenski helped to track this down.
- While fixing Hashkeeper support, improved support for other hash
    file formats and generalized the code in files.c
- Fixed a bug for displaying the correct matching filename in -w mode
    (ensured that extra characters are erased)
- Fixed cosmetic bug to avoid extra characters on time estimation mode
- Removed 32-bit number limitation from Win32 code, which allows 
    the display of file sizes larger than 4GB. (Note that time estimates
    for files larger than 4GB is still not available on Windows.)
- Switched printing of large numbers to C99 style (e.g. PRIu64 et al)
- Simplified the operating systems defines in the Makefile. To wit:
     - Removed -D__MACOSX for Mac. Instead check for __APPLE__, which 
       the compiler defines by default for us.
     - Removed the -D__UNIX directive. Instead just check the __WIN32
       is *not* defined whenever we put in *nix code.


Version 1.6 - 4 May 2005

- Added Whirlpool algorithm to make whirlpooldeep.
- Fixed bug to prevent trying to access 'busy' files. This happens when
    trying to access system files on Win32 that are mounted via Samba.

    the input file
- Added -b flag to remove leading directory information from filenames
- Added -a and -A flags to add a single hash to 
    positive and negative matching, respectively
- Removed -t as a valid flag, breaking compatibility with md5sum

Version 1.4 - 16 Aug 2004

- Added relative paths mode
- Fixed printing of file sizes larger than 9GB for Mac, *BSD.

   output and avoid spanning multiple lines

(better late than never!)
